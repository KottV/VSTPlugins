# WaveCymbal
![](img/wavecymbal.png)

WaveCymbal is an attempt to make a cymbal synthesizer with banded wave-guide model. The result is more like dragging bunch of empty cans or thin metal plate on asphalt rather than cymbal.

The package includes following builds:

- Windows 64bit
- Linux 64bit
- macOS 64bit

macOS build isn't tested because I don't have Mac. If you found a bug, please file a issue to [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ryukau/VSTPlugins) or send email to `ryukau@gmail.com`.

Linux build is built on Ubuntu 18.0.4 and tested on Bitwig 3.0.3 and Reaper 5.983. Both seems to have problem to display GUI, therefore GUI is currently disabled for Linux build.

## Installation
Place `WaveCymbal.vst3` directory to:

- `/Program Files/Common Files/VST3/` for Windows.
- `$HOME/.vst3/` for Linux.
- `/Users/$USERNAME/Library/Audio/Plug-ins/VST3/` for macOS.

DAW may provides additional VST3 directory. For more information, please refer to the manual of the DAW.

### Linux Specific
On Ubuntu 18.0.4, those packages are required.

```bash
sudo apt install libxcb-cursor0  libxkbcommon-x11-0
```

If DAW doesn't recognize the plugin, take a look at `Package Requirements` section of the link below and make sure all the VST3 related package is installed.

- [VST 3 Interfaces: Setup Linux for building VST 3 Plug-ins](https://steinbergmedia.github.io/vst3_doc/vstinterfaces/linuxSetup.html)

REAPER 5.983 on Linux may not recognize WaveCymbal. A workaround is to delete a file `~/.config/REAPER/reaper-vstplugins64.ini` and restart REAPER.

## Controls
Knob and slider can do:

- Ctrl + Left Click: Reset value.
- Shift + Left Drag: Fine adjustment.

Right clicking on controllable object popups a context menu provided by DAW.

## Caution
Parameters that turns red when pointing can drastically change output gain. Changing those parameters with Shift + Left Drag is recommended. To prevent sudden clipping, always insert limiter after WaveCymbal.

## Parameters
### Gain
Output gain.

### Excitation
Short delays that turns impulse to tone.

#### Feedback
Feedback of excitor delays.

#### Time
Delay time of excitor delays. Beware that when the value of this parameter is high, output will be loud.

### Objects
#### nCymbal
Number of cymbal-ish objects.

#### nString
Number of Karplus-Strong string per cymbal object.

### Wave
#### Damping
Damping of 1D wave simulation. Beware that when the value of this parameter is high, output will be loud.

#### PulsePosition
Position where oscillator input causes wave.

#### PulseWidth
Width of wave caused by oscillator input.

### Collision
When turns on, it sounds like a rubbing on surface of thin light metal plate. When `nCymbal` is 1, this doesn't change output sound.

#### Distance
Distance between cymbals. Collision will more likely to occur when turning this knob to left.

### Random
#### Seed
Random seed. Output will be the same for each note while checking `Retrigger`.

#### Amount
Amount of random number effects to delay time and band-pass cutoff. Beware that when the value of this parameter is low, output may be loud.

### String
#### MinHz
Lower bound of Karplus-Strong string frequency.

#### MaxHz
Upper bound of Karplus-Strong string frequency.

#### Decay
Decay of Karplus-Strong string. Decay time will be longer when turning this knob to left.

#### Q
Band-pass filter Q.

### Oscillator
#### Retrigger
When checking, each note on resets random seed.

#### OscType
Oscillator type.

- `Off` : Stop making noise for each note on. This option will be used when using WaveCymbal as FX.
- `Impulse` : Outputs impulse for each note on. Simulates hit of cymbal with stick.
- `Sustain` : Outputs impulse train with pitch of note. Simulates drawing of bow on surface of cymbal.
- `Velvet Noise` : Outputs velvet noise of a density respect to pitch of note. Simulates less uniform drawing than `Sustain`.
- `Brown Noise` : Outputs brown noise of a brightness respect to pitch of note. Kind of like dragging cymbal on asphalt.

#### Bandpass Cutoff Distribution
- `Log` : Sound becomes relatively natural.
- `Linear` : Leans sound to higher frequency.

### Smoothness
Transition time from previous value to current value in seconds. `Gain`, `Excitation.Time`, `Random.Amount`, `Bandpass.MinCutoff`, `Bandpass.MaxCutoff` will be affected. Slide effect of `OscType.Sustain` can be tuned by `Smoothness`.

## Change Log
- 0.1.1
  - Fixed smoothing algorithm to prevent blow up.
- 0.1.0
  - Initial release.
