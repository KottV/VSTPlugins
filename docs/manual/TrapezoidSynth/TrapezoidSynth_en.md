# TrapezoidSynth
![](img/trapezoidsynth.png)

TrapezoidSynth is a monophonic synthesizer equipped with 2 trapezoid oscillator. Trapezoid oscillator is based on PTR (Polynomial Transition Regions) and it has a drawback that increasing noise at high frequency. Therefore 8 times oversampled. 2 pitch shifters are added to make some chord.

The package includes following builds:

- Windows 64bit
- Linux 64bit
- macOS 64bit

macOS build isn't tested because I don't have Mac. If you found a bug, please file a issue to [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ryukau/VSTPlugins) or send email to `ryukau@gmail.com`.

Linux build is built on Ubuntu 18.0.4 and tested on Bitwig 3.0.3 and Reaper 5.983. Both seems to have problem to display GUI, therefore GUI is currently disabled for Linux build.

## Installation
Place `TrapezoidSynth.vst3` directory to:

- `/Program Files/Common Files/VST3/` for Windows.
- `$HOME/.vst3/` for Linux.
- `/Users/$USERNAME/Library/Audio/Plug-ins/VST3/` for macOS.

DAW may provides additional VST3 directory. For more information, please refer to the manual of the DAW.

### Linux Specific
On Ubuntu 18.0.4, those packages are required.

```bash
sudo apt install libxcb-cursor0  libxkbcommon-x11-0
```

If DAW doesn't recognize the plugin, take a look at `Package Requirements` section of the link below and make sure all the VST3 related package is installed.

- [VST 3 Interfaces: Setup Linux for building VST 3 Plug-ins](https://steinbergmedia.github.io/vst3_doc/vstinterfaces/linuxSetup.html)

REAPER 5.983 on Linux may not recognize TrapezoidSynth. A workaround is to delete a file `~/.config/REAPER/reaper-vstplugins64.ini` and restart REAPER.

## Controls
Knob and slider can do:

- Ctrl + Left Click: Reset value.
- Shift + Left Drag: Fine adjustment.

Right clicking on controllable object popups a context menu provided by DAW.

## Caution
It is recommended to insert high-pass when setting `SlideType` to `Reset to 0`.

## Parameters
### Oscillator Common
#### Semi
Change oscillator pitch in semitone.

#### Cent
Change oscillator pitch in cent. 100 cent = 1 semitone.

#### Slope
Change left and right side of slope of trapezoid.

#### PW
Pulse width. Change length of upper side of trapezoid.

### Oscillator 1
#### Drift
Modulate pitch with white noise.

#### Feedback
Modulate phase of Oscillator 1 with feedback signal.

```
osc1Phase += Feedback * (osc1 + OscMix * (osc2 - osc1))
```

### Oscillator 2
#### Overtone
Multiply the frequency of oscillator by number of `Overtone`.

#### PM
Modulate Osillator 1 phase with Oscillator 2 output.

### Envelope Common
#### Retrigger
When checked, reset envelope for each note on. When not checked, reset envelope only if the number of pressed key is changed from 0 to 1 or more.

#### A
Attack time in seconds.

#### D
Decay time in seconds.

#### S
Sustain level.

#### R
Release time in seconds.

#### Curve
Change envelope curve.

### Gain Envelope
#### Gain
Master output gain.

### Filter
#### Order
TrapezoidSynth is using 8 of serially connected first order filter. `Order` changes where to get the signal from the filter.

#### Cut
Cutoff frequency in Hz.

#### Res
Resonance.

#### Sat
Filter saturation.

```
filterInput = tanh(Sat * (input + Res * filterOutput))
```

#### Env>Cut
Modulation amount from Filter Envelope to `Cut`.

#### Key>Cut
Modulation amount from note pitch to `Cut`.

#### +OscMix

### Filter Envelope
#### >Octave
Modulation amount from Filter Envelope to pitch in octave.

### Misc
#### OscMix
Ratio of Oscillator 1 and Oscillator 2. When turned to left-most, output becomes only the signal from Oscillator 1.

#### Octave
Change pitch in octave.

#### Smooth
Interpolation time in seconds from previous value to current value. Following parameters are affected by `Smooth`.

- `Drift`
- `Slope`
- `PW` (for all parameter with identical name)
- `Feedback` (for all parameter with identical name)
- `PM`
- `Gain` (for all parameter with identical name)

- `Shifter2.Cent`
- `Freq`
- `Shape`
- `>Pitch1`
- `>Slope1`
- `>PW1`
- `>Cut`

### Mod Common
#### Retrigger
When checked, reset envelope for each note on. When not checked, reset envelope only if the number of pressed key is changed from 0 to 1 or more.

#### Attack
Modulation envelope attack time in seconds.

#### Curve
Modulation envelope curve.

### Mod 1
#### >PM
Modulation amount from modulation envelope 1 to `Oscillator2.PM`.

### Mod 2
#### >Feedback
Modulation amount from modulation envelope 2 to `Oscillator1.Feedback`.

#### >LFO
Modulation amount from modulation envelope 2 to `LFO.Freq`.

#### >Slope2
Modulation amount from modulation envelope 2 to `Oscillator2.Slope`.

#### >Shifter1
Modulation amount from modulation envelope 2 to Shifter 1 pitch.

### Shifter Common
#### Semi
Change amount of pitch shift in semitone.

#### Cent
Change amount of pitch shift pitch in cent. 100 cent = 1 semitone.

#### Gain
Output gain of pitch shifter.

### LFO
#### LFOType
4 waveforms are available for LFO.

- `Sin` : Sine wave. Output will be power of the value of `Shape`.
- `Saw` : Sawtooth wave. Can be turned into triangle with `Shape`.
- `Pulse` : Pulse wave. Duty ratio can be controlled by `Shape`.
- `Noise` : Brown noise. Wandering of noise can be changed by `Shape`.

#### Tempo

### Slide
#### SlideType
3 type of pitch slide is available.

- `Always` : Always slide from the pitch of last note.
- `Sustain` : Only slide when 2 or more keys are pressed.
- `Reset to 0` : When number of pressed key is changed from 0 to 1, or 1 to 0, pitch will be slide to 0 Hz. Otherwise, slide behaves same as other 2 options.

#### Time
