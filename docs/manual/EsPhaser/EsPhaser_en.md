# EsPhaser
![](img/esphaser.png)

EsPhaser is a phaser with up to 4096 stages of order 2 Thiran all-pass filters. This is the same phaser used in EnvelopedSine.

EsPhaser requires CPU which supports AVX or later SIMD instructions.

The package includes following builds:

- Windows 64bit
- Linux 64bit
- macOS 64bit

macOS build isn't tested because I don't have Mac. If you found a bug, please file a issue to [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ryukau/VSTPlugins) or send email to `ryukau@gmail.com`.

Linux build is built on Ubuntu 18.0.4 and tested on Bitwig 3.1.2 and Reaper 6.03. Bitwig 3.1.2 seems to have a bug that occasionally blackouts GUI.

## Installation
### Plugin
Place `*.vst3` directory to:

- `/Program Files/Common Files/VST3/` for Windows.
- `$HOME/.vst3/` for Linux.
- `/Users/$USERNAME/Library/Audio/Plug-ins/VST3/` for macOS.

DAW may provides additional VST3 directory. For more information, please refer to the manual of the DAW.

### Presets
Extract preset zip, then place preset directory to the OS specific path:

- Windows : `/Users/$USERNAME/Documents/VST3 Presets/Uhhyou`
- Linux : `$HOME/.vst3/presets/Uhhyou`
- macOS : `/Users/$USERNAME/Library/Audio/Presets/Uhhyou`

Preset directory name must be the same as the plugin. Make `Uhhyou` directory if it does not exist.

### Windows Specific
If DAW doesn't recognize the plugin, try installing C++ redistributable (`vc_redist.x64.exe`). Installer can be found in the link below.

- [The latest supported Visual C++ downloads](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads)

### Linux Specific
On Ubuntu 18.0.4, those packages are required.

```bash
sudo apt install libxcb-cursor0  libxkbcommon-x11-0
```

If DAW doesn't recognize the plugin, take a look at `Package Requirements` section of the link below and make sure all the VST3 related package is installed.

- [VST 3 Interfaces: Setup Linux for building VST 3 Plug-ins](https://steinbergmedia.github.io/vst3_doc/vstinterfaces/linuxSetup.html)

REAPER on Linux may not recognize the plugin. A workaround is to delete a file `~/.config/REAPER/reaper-vstplugins64.ini` and restart REAPER.

## Controls
Knob and number slider can do:

- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kdb>Left Click</kbd>: Reset value.
- <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Left Drag</kbd>: Fine adjustment.

## Caution
When stage is set to 4096, it will be CPU intensive.

Output varies in different sample rate.

Output may be loud when changing Cas. Offset. Use  <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Left Drag</kbd> to slowly change the value, or insert limiter to prevent hard clipping.

## Block Diagram
If the image is small, use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Mouse Wheel</kbd> or "View Image" on right click menu to scale.

Diagram only shows overview. It's not exact implementation.

## Parameters
Stages

:   Number of all-pass filter.
    
Mix

:   Mixing ratio of dry/wet signal of phaser. `Dry : Wet` becomes `0 : 1` when turned the knob to rightmost.
    
Freq

:   LFO frequency.
    
Spread

:   Spread frequency between LFOs.
    
    Equation for difference of LFO phase in 1 sample:
    
    ```
    deltaPhase = 2 * pi * Freq / ((1 + LfoIndex * Spread) * sampleRate)
    ```
    
Feedback

:   Amount of feedback. Feedback is disabled when the knob is pointing to 12 o'clock. It becomes negative feedback when turned to left and positive feedback when turned to right.
    
Range

:   Range of all-pass filter modulation by LFO.
    
Min

:   Minimum value of all-pass filter modulation by LFO.
    
Cas. Offset

:   Phase offset between 16 LFO.
    
L/R Offset

:   LFO phase offset between L/R channels.
    
Phase

:   LFO phase. This can be used to make sound with automation. Turning `Freq` to leftmost sets LFO frequency to 0.
    
    Equation for phase offset:
    
    ```
    LfoPhaseOffset = Phase + (L/R Offset) + LfoIndex * (Cas. Offset)
    ```
